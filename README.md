============

Google App Script taking data from a spreadsheet and putting into pre-formatted doc

This is just the code from the script manager. it won't really work until put into the script on the spreadsheet in question. You also have to create a new menu item to fire the application to create the document on demand from spreadsheet data. 

Begin by creating a form in Drive and storing the data in spreadsheet. Then add this code to the spreadsheets script manager (or get the spreadsheets ID number and hard code it into the script, but that's a major pain in the rear).
